	Abstract = {Knowledge sharing communities can be found in many organizations,
	but their forms and functions appear to be quite diverse. This implies
	that questions concerning the functioning of communities, (how do
	they work) and questions concerning success conditions (how to organize
	and facilitate them) cannot be answered in a general way. The purpose
	of this article is to develop the theory in this area by discovering
	basic dimensions along which communities differ, and by identifying
	basic types of knowledge communities, underlying the diversity of
	knowledge sharing groups. Through an analysis of the literature and
	of a series of communities in large organizations, two basic dimensions
	and five archetypes of knowledge communities are identified.},

	Abstract = {This research aims at understanding how people share knowledge in
	their everyday work in a project-based company. The social structures
	for knowledge sharing are characterised as formal, informal, and
	quasi-informal structures. They vary from those with high formalisation
	to the informal, and even include structures which are invisible
	and unrecognised in the organisation. They also vary in their composition.
	They may share the same or different space, and communication is
	based on face-to-face or virtual interaction. Data was collected
	by means of documents and interviews (n=18) during the autumn of
	2002 and the winter of 2003 from an Internet consultancy company.
	The study shows the great variety of formal, informal, and quasi-informal
	social structures that are used for knowledge sharing in the case
	company. In all, sixteen different structures were found. The number
	of formal structures is smaller than the number of informal ones.
	Their analysis in terms of five dimensions also shows their great
	heterogeneity.},

	Abstract = {Saying that networks are important is stating the obvious. But harnessing
	the power of these seemingly invisible groups to achieve organizational
	goals is an elusive undertaking. Most efforts to promote collaboration
	are haphazard and built on the implicit philosophy that more connectivity
	is better In truth, networks create relational demands that sap people's
	time and energy and can bog down entire organizations. it's crucial
	for executives to learn how to promote connectivity only where it
	benefits an organization or individual and to decrease unnecessary
	connections. In this article, the authors introduce three types of
	social networks, each of which delivers unique value. The customized
	response network excels at framing the ambiguous problems involved
	in innovation. Strategy consulting firms and new-product development
	groups rely on this format. By contrast, surgical teams and law firms
	rely mostly on the modular response network, which works best when
	components of the problem are known but the sequence of those components
	in the solution is unknown. And the routine response network is best
	suited for organizations like call centers, where the problems and
	solutions are fairly predictable but collaboration is still needed.
	Executives shouldn't simply hope that collaboration will spontaneously
	occur in the right places at the right times in their organization.
	They need to develop a strategic, nuanced view of collaboration,
	and they must take steps to ensure that their companies support the
	types of social networks that best fit their goals. Drawing on examples
	from Novartis, the FAA, and Sallie Mae, the authors offer managers
	the tools they need to determine which network will deliver the best
	results for their organizations and which strategic investments will
	nurture the right degree of connectivity.},

	Abstract = {At the heart of knowledge management (KM) are the people -- an organization's
	important knowledge asset. Although this is widely acknowledged,
	businesses seldom understand this axiom in terms of the communities
	through which individuals develop and share the capacity to create
	and use knowledge. It is the collective learning that takes place
	within the social systems, i.e. communities of practice (CoP) that
	are of particular significance to an organization from a KM perspective.
	This paper aims to review, critique, and raise some pertinent questions
	on the role of CoPs; and with the help of case studies shed light
	on the "goings-on" in construction practices. After critically reviewing
	the literature on CoPs and querying some underlying assertions, this
	research investigates how these issues are addressed in practice.
	A case study approach is adopted. From the findings, it is clear
	that the question is not whether communities exist within organizations,
	but how they deliver value to the organization.},

	abstract = {The perspective of modeling knowledge in Artificial Intelligence is that these models are equal to the knowledge itself (e.g. equate the map with the territory). This encoding view treats knowledge as if it were primarily verbal and assumes that verbal concepts themselves can be replaced by descriptions of concepts{}as if a body of descriptions and neural categorizations were equivalent mechanisms for generating behavior.[ ] This paper describes a number of concepts around the notion of {}situatedness: situated cognition, situated action, situated learning, and the concept of autopoiesis as an organizing principle. Situatedness changes the way we think about how knowledge is created (learning) and applied (action). In this light knowledge management changes its meaning from managing the knowledge of an organization to managing the situation in which learning happens. Collaboration and participation become the key management principles. In this paper we propose that Brahms (Business Re-design Agent-based Holistic Modeling System), an activity-based multi-agent modeling environment, allows us to model knowledge in situated actions and learning in human activities.},

	abstract = {This special issue of Janus Head explores a number of disciplinary and interdisciplinary dimensions of the theme, the situated body. The body, of course, is always situated in so far as it is a living and experiencing body. Being situated in this sense is different from simply being located someplace in the way a non-living, non-experiencing object is located. That the body is always situated involves certain kinds of physical and social interactions, and it means that experience is always both physically and socially situated. The interesting question is not only how this works (what precisely it means to be situated), but whether and how the answer to that question changes from one situation to another. It seems reasonable to say that the body is situated differently in different situations, and that this difference may not be simply a difference in the situational content but a difference in how the body processes being situated precisely because the circumstances are so different. The question is not just about differences in situations, but differences in situatedness. Is it possible that the body is X-situated (in terms of its situatedness) in the task of solving a mathematical problem, but is Y-situated when it is engaged in dancing with another person? And if, as seems obvious, there are signi{}cant physiological and experiential differences involved in being in these different situations, are some of these differences due to being X-situated, for example, rather than Y-situated? This collection of essays gathers together investigations of the situated body that address such variations in what it means to be situated. These investigations cross theory and practice, expression and performance and interweave disciplines and practices such as philosophical anthropology, cognitive science, phenomenology, architecture and painting, and artistic performances like dance and music. They describe the body as an experiencing enactive agent embedded in various pragmatic and social circumstances, the body as rigidly circumscribed in art and science, and the body as extended into its environment through the high technology that is more and more defining our experiences and our relationships..},

  abstract = {The paper proposes a more formalized definition of UML 2.0 Activity Diagram
semantics. A subset of activity diagram constructs relevant for business
process modeling is considered. The semantics definition is based on the
original token flow methodology, but a more constructive approach is used. The
Activity Diagram Virtual machine is defined by means of a metamodel, with
operations defined by a mix of pseudocode and OCL pre- and postconditions. A
formal procedure is described which builds the virtual machine for any activity
diagram. The relatively complicated original token movement rules in control
nodes and edges are combined into paths from an action to action. A new
approach is the use of different (push and pull) engines, which move tokens
along the paths. Pull engines are used for paths containing join nodes, where
the movement of several tokens must be coordinated. The proposed virtual
machine approach makes the activity semantics definition more transparent where
the token movement can be easily traced. However, the main benefit of the
approach is the possibility to use the defined virtual machine as a basis for
UML activity diagram based workflow or simulation engine.},

  abstract = {The governance of natural resources used by many individuals in common is an issue of increasing concern to policy analysts. Both state control and privatisation of resources have been advocated, but neither the state nor the market have been uniformly successful in solving common pool resource problems. Offering a critique of the foundations of policy analysis as applied to natural resources, Elinor Ostrom here provides a unique body of empirical data to explore conditions under which common pool resource problems have been satisfactorily or unsatisfactorily solved. Dr Ostrom first describes three models most frequently used as the foundation for recommending state or market solutions. She then outlines theoretical and empirical alternatives to these models in order to illustrate the diversity of possible solutions. In the following chapters she uses institutional analysis to examine different ways - both successful and unsuccessful - of governing the commons. In contrast to the proposition of the tragedy of the commons argument, common pool problems sometimes are solved by voluntary organisations rather than by a coercive state. Among the cases considered are communal tenure in meadows and forests, irrigation communities and other water rights, and fisheries.},

  abstract = {The architecture of complex software or systems is a collection of
	hard decisions that are very expensive to change. Successful product
	development and evolution depend on making the right architectural
	choices. Can you afford not to identify and not to evaluate these
	choices? The authors of this book are experts in software architecture
	and its evaluation. They collected a wealth of ideas and experience
	in a well-organized and accessible form. If you are involved in the
	development of complex systems or software, you will find this book
	an invaluable guide for establishing and improving architecture evaluation
	practice in your organization. In particular, the book presents three
	important evaluation methods: Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method
	(ATAM), Software Architecture Analysis Method (SAAM), and Active
	Reviews for Intermediate Designs (ARID). Detailed case studies demonstrate
	the value and practical application of these methods to real-world
	systems, and sidebars throughout the book provide interesting background
	and hands-on tips from the trenches.},

  journal = {Mathematical Structures in Computer Science},

  number = {4},
  abstract = {Gamma is a programming model in which computation can be seen as chemical
	reactions between data represented as molecules floating in a chemical
	solution. This model can be formalised as associative, commutative,
	conditional rewritings of multisets where rewrite rules and multisets
	represent chemical reactions and solutions, respectively. In this
	article we generalise the notion of multiset used by Gamma and present
	applications through various programming examples. First, multisets
	are generalised to include rewrite rules, which become first-class
	citizens. This extension is formalised by the \${\textbackslash}gamma\$-calculus,
	which is a chemical model that summarises in a few rules the essence
	of higher-order chemical programming. By extending the \${\textbackslash}gamma\$-calculus
	with constants, operators, types and expressive patterns, we build
	a higher-order chemical programming language called {HOCL.} Finally,
	multisets are further generalised by allowing elements to have infinite
	and negative multiplicities. Semantics, implementation and applications
	of this extension are considered.}

  abstract = {Purpose - Prior research on managing communities of practice (CoP)
	has not investigated top management's involvement in detail. The
	purpose of this paper is to present three detailed and successful
	mechanisms through which top management contributes to the guidance
	of Cops. Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents an investigation
	of 47 CoPs conducted in several organizations. Data collection was
	achieved using a qualitative questionnaire, followed by in-depth
	interviews with leaders of CoPs. Findings - This study explored three
	mechanisms used by sponsors to successfully guide CoPs. More specifically,
	the findings highlight a set of operational means used by top management
	- via sponsors to supervise and facilitate best practice development
	and sharing within CoPs. Research limitations/implications - The
	CoPs should be examined by means of an ethnological approach, thus
	interacting with many members of the same CoP to gain an in-depth-understanding
	of each mechanisms significance for the sponsorship 3 success. There
	is also a need to further explore how the three sponsorship mechanisms
	are interrelated. Originality/value - Through numerous examples extracted
	from different multinational organizations, this paper offers clear
	guidelines for top managers on how to improve their support to CoPs
	in their organization.},

  abstract = {The architecture of complex software or systems is a collection of
	hard decisions that are very expensive to change. Successful product
	development and evolution depend on making the right architectural
	choices. Can you afford not to identify and not to evaluate these
	choices? The authors of this book are experts in software architecture
	and its evaluation. They collected a wealth of ideas and experience
	in a well-organized and accessible form. If you are involved in the
	development of complex systems or software, you will find this book
	an invaluable guide for establishing and improving architecture evaluation
	practice in your organization. In particular, the book presents three
	important evaluation methods: Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method
	(ATAM), Software Architecture Analysis Method (SAAM), and Active
	Reviews for Intermediate Designs (ARID). Detailed case studies demonstrate
	the value and practical application of these methods to real-world
	systems, and sidebars throughout the book provide interesting background
	and hands-on tips from the trenches.},

	Organization},
  journal = {MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},
  year = {2004},
  volume = {50},
  pages = {352--364},
  number = {3},
  month = {March},
  abstract = {Effective work groups engage in external knowledge sharing--the exchange
	of information, know-how, and feedback with customers, organizational
	experts, and others outside of the group. This paper argues that
	the value of external knowledge sharing increases when work groups
	are more structurally diverse. A structurally diverse work group
	is one in which the members, by virtue of their different organizational
	affiliations, roles, or positions, can expose the group to unique
	sources of knowledge. It is hypothesized that if members of structurally
	diverse work groups engage in external knowledge sharing, their performance
	will improve because of this active exchange of knowledge through
	unique external sources. A field study of 182 work groups in a Fortune
	500 telecommunications firm operationalizes structural diversity
	as member differences in geographic locations, functional assignments,
	reporting managers, and business units, as indicated by corporate
	database records. External knowledge sharing was measured with group
	member surveys and performance was assessed using senior executive
	ratings. Ordered logit analyses showed that external knowledge sharing
	was more strongly associated with performance when work groups were
	more structurally diverse. Implications for theory and practice around
	the integration of work groups and social networks are addressed.

  abstract = {In its simplest form, Business Process Management (BPM) is a suite
	of software technologies focusing on the management of the complete
	lifecycle of a business process. To date, most BPM deployments have
	been narrow in scope, adopting an organization-centric view and providing
	only improvements in specific business functions. As a result, current
	BPM suites only enable organizations to enhance their existing processes.
	The next-generation of service-enabled BPM will serve as a means
	of developing mission-critical applications based on strategic technology
	capable of creating and executing cross- enterprise collaborative
	business processes and business-aware transactions, so that organizations
	can deploy, monitor, and continuously update cross-enterprise functions
	within a mixed environment of people, content, and systems. Such
	collaborative, complex end-to-end service interactions give raise
	to the concept of Agile Service Networks. In this report, we assess
	the state-of-the-art in BPM, surveying the basic concepts, describe
	the features, techniques and enabling technologies necessary for
	making BPM a reality and explain the need for service-based BPM.
	The report also highlights the need for moving from a relatively
	static and organization-centric view of BPM to a much more dynamic,
	high- value one based on Agile Service Networks.},

	a structured technique for understanding the tradeoffs inherent in

	fitness with respect to multiple competing quality attributes: modifiability,
	security, performance, availability, and so forth. These attributes
	interact-improving one often comes at the price of worsening one
	or more of the others-as is shown in the paper, and the method helps
	us to reason about architectural decisions that affect quality attribute
	interactions. The {ATAM} is a spiral model of design: one of postulating
	candidate architectures followed by analysis and risk mitigation,
	leading to refined architectures},

  abstract = {Many architectural languages have been proposed in the last 15 years,
	each one with the chief aim of becoming the ideal language for specifying
	software architectures. What is evident nowadays, instead, is that
	architectural languages are defined by stakeholder concerns. Capturing
	all such concerns within a single, narrowly focused notation is impossible.
	At the same time, it is also impractical to define and use a {\^{a}}€{\oe}universal{\^{a}}€?
	notation, such as UML. As a result, many domain-specific notations
	for architectural modeling have been proposed, each one focusing
	on a specific application domain, analysis type, or modeling environment.
	As a drawback, a proliferation of languages exists, each one with
	its own specific notation, tools, and domain specificity. No effective
	interoperability is possible to date. Therefore, if a software architect
	has to model a concern not supported by his own language/tool, he
	has to manually transform (and, eventually, keep aligned) the available
	architectural specification into the required language/tool. This
	paper presents DUALLy, an automated framework that allows architectural
	languages and tools interoperability. Given a number of architectural
	languages and tools, they can all interoperate thanks to automated
	model transformation techniques. DUALLy is implemented as an Eclipse
	plugin. Putting it in practice, we apply the DUALLy approach to the
	Darwin/FSP ADL and to a UML2.0 profile for software architectures.
	By making use of an industrial complex system, we transform a UML
	software architecture specification in Darwin/FSP, make some verifications
	by using LTSA, and reflect changes required by the verifications
	back to the UML specification.},

	from defining system operations (i.e., functional specification)
	to describing how people will use a system to accomplish work tasks
	and other activities. However, unlike approaches that consider human
	behavior and experience through formal analysis and modeling of well-specified
	tasks, scenario-based design is a relatively lightweight method for
	envisioning future use possibilities. A user interaction scenario
	is a sketch of use. It is intended to vividly capture the essence
	of an interaction design, much as a two-dimensional, paper-and-pencil

	This paper aims to review, critique, and raise some pertinent questions
	on the role of CoPs; and with the help of case studies shed light
	on the "goings-on" in construction practices. After critically reviewing
	the literature on CoPs and querying some underlying assertions, this

	A case study approach is adopted. From the findings, it is clear

	small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them
	‘small-world’ networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon13,14
	(popularly known as six degrees of separation15). The neural network
	of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western
	United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown

  publisher = {Princeton University Press},
  year = {2005},
  editor = {Latham, Robert and Sassen, Saskia},
  address = {Princeton, NJ},
  abstract = {Review Comprehensive and insightful, Digital Formations will be greeted
	warmly in the fields that overlap its concerns. It addresses a most
	important set of questions concerning the relationship of information
	technologies to globalization. And this is an urgent topic for social
	science.
	
	Book Description Computer-centered networks and technologies are reshaping
	social relations and constituting new social domains on a global
	scale, from virtually borderless electronic markets and Internet-based
	large-scale conversations to worldwide open source software development
	communities, transnational corporate production systems, and the
	global knowledge-arenas associated with NGO networks. This book explores
	how such 'digital formations' emerge from the ever-changing intersection
	of computer-centered technologies and the broad range of social contexts
	that underlie much of what happens in cyberspace.
	
	While viewing technologies fundamentally in social rather than technical
	terms, Digital Formations nonetheless emphasizes the importance of
	recognizing the specific technical capacities of digital technologies.
	Importantly, it identifies digital formations as a new area of study
	in the social sciences and in thinking about globalization. The ten
	chapters, by leading scholars, examine key social, political, and
	economic developments associated with these new configurations of
	organization, space, and interaction. They address the operation
	of digital formations and their implications for the development
	of longstanding institutions and for their wider contexts and fields,
	and they consider the political, economic, and other forces shaping
	those formations and how the formations, in turn, are shaping such
	forces.
	
	Following a conceptual introduction by the editors are chapters by
	Hayward Alker, Jonathan Bach and David Stark, Lars-Erik Cederman
	and Peter A. Kraus, Dieter Ernst, D. Linda Garcia, Doug Guthrie,
	Robert Latham, Warren Sack, Saskia Sassen, and Steven Weber.},
