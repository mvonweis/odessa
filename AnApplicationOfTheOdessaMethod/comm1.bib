These metaphors make possible distinct observations about turbulent organizational processes that have previously been described as "chaotic." Careful distinction between the metaphors affords additional insight into organizational processes and can aid theory development. The metaphors are integrated into organizational process research through application to two current process theory taxonomies. New research directions in managing turbulence and constructing process models are suggested.},

  abstract = {The recent advent of Web mashups that enable ad hoc integration of information and services from multiple disparate resources brings into the spotlight a new approach for managing situational projects in organizations. Situational projects are unpredictable and transient projects within an organization that come with limited number of users with specific needs. Handling these projects differs from traditional project management approaches. They need rapid and good enough solutions. In this paper a simple and organized approach for managing situational projects is proposed. The proposed approach tries to handle situational projects by creating a mashup infrastructure in the organization. There are three types of participants in our approach: mashup manager, mashup resource analyst and mashup resource builder. Cooperation between these participants results in managing a situational project. Furthermore a meaningful real world scenario is defined to describe different steps of the approach. In addition, advantages of the proposed approach are identified and challenges of using Web mashups along with guidelines to cope with them are expressed.},

	Abstract = {This paper derives from a longitudinal study conducted in a multinational
	company. Through an interpretive case study approach, we have explored
	the phenomenon of knowledge networking in distributed work. More
	specifically, we have focused on the evolution patterns in a particular
	knowledge networking structure denoted as distributed networks of
	practice. The paper conceptualizes this kind of network of practice
	as an information and communication technology (ICT) facilitated
	dynamic relationship of participants that are geographically and
	temporally dispersed from one another, and who are sharing and creating
	knowledge related to their daily work practices and business problems.
	Three different categories of networks were identified 1) problem
	solving networks, 2) business improvement networks, and 3) innovation
	networks. Findings demonstrate that the networks evolved differently
	over time, and the study identified four distinct evolution patterns
	comprising 1) devolution in terms of short life cycle and dissolution,
	2) recursive patterns where new ad-hoc networks emerged from the
	mother network, 3) integration of knowledge practices through cross-network
	proposals, and 4) innovation and expansion in scope and size. While
	previous studies have suggested fixed models for how a life cycle
	of a community takes place, this study however identified four dissimilar
	evolution patterns. Thus, these findings challenge life cycles models
	suggested in traditional community of practice research. The paper
	utilizes an information infrastructure perspective to provide an
	improved understanding of the evolution patterns within these networks
	by viewing them as ecological social structures facilitated by a
	technological infrastructure. Through social lines of practice and
	effective knowledge sharing, the participants created an infrastructure
	of knowing within the organization and managed to alter organizational
	practices through evolution. The paper illustrates how a knowledge
	networking structure as such may facilitate distributed work practices
	and knowledge activities across temporal and spatial boundaries.},

	and use knowledge. It is the collective learning that takes place
	within the social systems, i.e. communities of practice (CoP) that
	are of particular significance to an organization from a KM perspective.
	This paper aims to review, critique, and raise some pertinent questions
	on the role of CoPs; and with the help of case studies shed light
	on the "goings-on" in construction practices. After critically reviewing
	the literature on CoPs and querying some underlying assertions, this
	research investigates how these issues are addressed in practice.
	A case study approach is adopted. From the findings, it is clear
	that the question is not whether communities exist within organizations,
	but how they deliver value to the organization.},

	Abstract = {Saying that networks are important is stating the obvious. But harnessing
	the power of these seemingly invisible groups to achieve organizational
	goals is an elusive undertaking. Most efforts to promote collaboration
	are haphazard and built on the implicit philosophy that more connectivity
	is better In truth, networks create relational demands that sap people's
	time and energy and can bog down entire organizations. it's crucial
	for executives to learn how to promote connectivity only where it
	benefits an organization or individual and to decrease unnecessary
	connections. In this article, the authors introduce three types of
	social networks, each of which delivers unique value. The customized
	response network excels at framing the ambiguous problems involved
	in innovation. Strategy consulting firms and new-product development
	groups rely on this format. By contrast, surgical teams and law firms
	rely mostly on the modular response network, which works best when
	components of the problem are known but the sequence of those components
	in the solution is unknown. And the routine response network is best
	suited for organizations like call centers, where the problems and
	solutions are fairly predictable but collaboration is still needed.
	Executives shouldn't simply hope that collaboration will spontaneously
	occur in the right places at the right times in their organization.
	They need to develop a strategic, nuanced view of collaboration,
	and they must take steps to ensure that their companies support the
	types of social networks that best fit their goals. Drawing on examples
	from Novartis, the FAA, and Sallie Mae, the authors offer managers
	the tools they need to determine which network will deliver the best
	results for their organizations and which strategic investments will
	nurture the right degree of connectivity.},

	abstract = {This special issue of Janus Head explores a number of disciplinary and interdisciplinary dimensions of the theme, the situated body. The body, of course, is always situated in so far as it is a living and experiencing body. Being situated in this sense is different from simply being located someplace in the way a non-living, non-experiencing object is located. That the body is always situated involves certain kinds of physical and social interactions, and it means that experience is always both physically and socially situated. The interesting question is not only how this works (what precisely it means to be situated), but whether and how the answer to that question changes from one situation to another. It seems reasonable to say that the body is situated differently in different situations, and that this difference may not be simply a difference in the situational content but a difference in how the body processes being situated precisely because the circumstances are so different. The question is not just about differences in situations, but differences in situatedness. Is it possible that the body is X-situated (in terms of its situatedness) in the task of solving a mathematical problem, but is Y-situated when it is engaged in dancing with another person? And if, as seems obvious, there are signi{}cant physiological and experiential differences involved in being in these different situations, are some of these differences due to being X-situated, for example, rather than Y-situated? This collection of essays gathers together investigations of the situated body that address such variations in what it means to be situated. These investigations cross theory and practice, expression and performance and interweave disciplines and practices such as philosophical anthropology, cognitive science, phenomenology, architecture and painting, and artistic performances like dance and music. They describe the body as an experiencing enactive agent embedded in various pragmatic and social circumstances, the body as rigidly circumscribed in art and science, and the body as extended into its environment through the high technology that is more and more defining our experiences and our relationships..},

     abstract = {An s stage k name snowball sampling procedure is defined as follows: A random sample of individuals is drawn from a given finite population. (The kind of random sample will be discussed later in this section.) Each individual in the sample is asked to name k different individuals in the population, where k is a specified integer; for example, each individual may be asked to name his "k best friends," or the "k individuals with whom he most frequently associates," or the "k individuals whose opinions he most frequently seeks," etc. (For the sake of simplicity, we assume throughout that an individual cannot include himself in his list of k individuals.) The individuals who were not in the random sample but were named by individuals in it form the first stage. Each of the individuals in the first stage is then asked to name k different individuals. (We assume that the question asked of the individuals in the random sample and of those in each stage is the same and that k is the same.) The individuals who were not in the random sample nor in the first stage but were named by individuals who were in the first stage form the second stage. Each of the individuals in the second stage is then asked to name k different individuals. The individuals who were not in the random sample nor in the first or second stages but were named by individuals who were in the second stage form the third stage. Each of the individuals in the third stage is then asked to name k different individuals. This procedure is continued until each of the individuals in the sth stage has been asked to name k different individuals. The data obtained using an s stage k name snowball sampling procedure can be utilized to make statistical inferences about various aspects of the relationships present in the population. The relationships present, in the hypothetical situation where each individual in the population is asked to name k different individuals, can be described by a matrix with rows and columns corresponding to the members of the population, rows for the individuals naming and columns for the individuals named, where the entry ?ij in the ith row and jth column is 1 if the ith individual in the population includes the jth individual among the k individuals he would name, and it is 0 otherwise. While the matrix of the ?'s cannot be known in general unless every individual in the population is interviewed (i.e., asked to name k different individuals), it will be possible to make statistical inferences about various aspects of this matrix from the data obtained using an s stage k name snowball sampling procedure. For example, when s = k = 1, the number, M11, of mutual relationships present in the population (i.e., the number of values i with ?ij = ?ji = 1 for some value of $j > i$ ) can be estimated. The methods of statistical inference applied to the data obtained from an s stage k name snowball sample will of course depend on the kind of random sample drawn as the initial step. In most of the present paper, we shall suppose that a random sample (i.e., the "zero stage" in snowball sample) is drawn so that the probability, p, that a given individual in the population will be in the sample is independent of whether a different given individual has appeared. This kind of sampling has been called binomial sampling; the specified value of p (assumed known) has been called the sampling fraction [4]. This sampling scheme might also be described by saying that a given individual is included in the sample just when a coin, which has a probability p of "heads," comes up "heads," where the tosses of the coin from individual to individual are independent. (To each individual there corresponds an independent Bernoulli trial determining whether he will or will not be included in the sample.) This sampling scheme differs in some respects from the more usual models where the sample size is fixed in advance or where the ratio of the sample size to the population size (i.e., the sample size-population size ratio) is fixed. For binomial sampling, this ratio is a random variable whose expected value is p. (The variance of this ratio approaches zero as the population becomes infinite.) In some situations (where, for example, the variance of this ratio is near zero), mathematical results obtained for binomial sampling are sometimes quite similar to results obtained using some of the more usual sampling models (see [4], [7]; compare the variance formulas in [3] and [5]); in such cases it will often not make much difference, from a practical point of view, which sampling model is utilized. (In Section 6 of the present paper some results for snowball sampling based on an initial sample of the more usual kind are obtained and compared with results presented in the earlier sections of this paper obtained for snowball sampling based on an initial binomial sample.) For snowball sampling based on an initial binomial sample, and with s = k = 1, so that each individual asked names just one other individual and there is just one stage beyond the initial sample, Section 2 of this paper discusses unbiased estimation of M11, the number of pairs of individuals in the population who would name each other. One of the unbiased estimators considered (among a certain specified class of estimators) has uniformly smallest variance when the population characteristics are unknown; this one is based on a sufficient statistic for a simplified summary of the data and is the only unbiased estimator of M11 based on that sufficient statistic (when the population characteristics are unknown). This estimator (when s = k = 1) has a smaller variance than a comparable minimum variance unbiased estimator computed from a larger random sample when s = 0 and k = 1 (i.e., where only the individuals in the random sample are interviewed) even where the expected number of individuals in the larger random sample (s = 0, k = 1) is equal to the maximum expected number of individuals studied when s = k = 1 (i.e., the sum of the expected number of individuals in the initial sample and the maximum expected number of individuals in the first stage). In fact, the variance of the estimator when s = 0 and k = 1 is at least twice as large as the variance of the comparable estimator when s = k = 1 even where the expected number of individuals studied when s = 0 and k = 1 is as large as the maximum expected number of individuals studied when s = k = 1. Thus, for estimating M11, the sampling scheme with s = k = 1 is preferable to the sampling scheme with s = 0 and k = 1. Furthermore, we observe that when s = k = 1 the unbiased estimator based on the simplified summary of the data having minimum variance when the population characteristics are unknown can be improved upon in cases where certain population characteristics are known, or where additional data not included in the simplified summary are available. Several improved estimators are derived and discussed. Some of the results for the special case of s = k = 1 are generalized in Sections 3 and 4 to deal with cases where s and k are any specified positive integers. In Section 5, results are presented about s stage k name snowball sampling procedures, where each individual asked to name k different individuals chooses k individuals at random from the population. (Except in Section 5, the numbers ?ij, which form the matrix referred to earlier, are assumed to be fixed (i.e., to be population parameters); in Section 5, they are random variables. A variable response error is not considered except in so far as Section 5 deals with an extreme case of this.) For social science literature that discusses problems related to snowball sampling, see [2], [8], and the articles they cite. This literature indicates, among other things, the importance of studying "social structure and...the relations among individuals" [2].},

  abstract = {The vision of the Social Semantic Desktop defines a user’s personal information environment as a source and end-point of the Semantic Web: Knowledge workers comprehensively express their information and data with respect to their own conceptualizations. Semantic Web languages and protocols are used to formalize these conceptualizations and for coordinating local and global information access. From the way this vision is being pursued in the NEPOMUK project, we identified several requirements and research questions with respect to knowledge representation. In addition to the general question of the expressivity needed in such a scenario, two main challenges come into focus: i) How can we cope with the heterogeneity of knowledge models and ontologies, esp. multiple knowledge modules with potentially different interpretations? ii) How can we support the tailoring of ontologies towards different needs in various exploiting applications? In this paper, we present NRL, an approach to these two question that is based on named graphs for the modularization aspect and a view concept for the tailoring of ontologies. This view concept turned out to be of additional value, as it also provides a mechanism to impose different semantics on the same syntactical structure. We think that the elements of our approach are not only adequate for the semantic desktop scenario, but are also of importance as building blocks for the general Semantic Web.},

@unpublished{phil,
  abstract = {The open innovation paradigm has got a lot of attention in both academic and business world lately. It arises from the idea that knowledge has spread widely and become more specific. All smart people do not work for us and companies could not survive on their own anymore. The open innovation approach aims at effective exploration of essential new innovations with profit maximization. It suggests that new innovations can also emerge from outside the boundaries of the company and may be commercialized by some other way than through company’s own processes and business units. Typically, the R{\&}D departments have been tightly closed from outsiders, but the important aspect of the new approach is collaboration with other companies, universities and other instances.

The variety of utilization options of the open innovation paradigm makes the approach difficult to adopt and adapt. On the other hand, there are many companies that have successfully implemented the open innovation even before the actual term had been launched by Chesbrough (2003). In the paper, we study the implementation of the open innovation paradigm in eight companies, Cisco Systems, DuPont, IBM, Intel, Lucent, P{\&}G, Philips, and Sun Microsystems, that have adopted the open approach to their innovation processes. These companies are good examples of implementing the new paradigm of innovation and represent different aspects of it; exploring new ideas from outside the company, collaborating with partners, licensing intellectual property, using venture capital and corporate venturing to create new start-ups, spinning-off technologies and practicing open source policy. The paper introduces their way to utilize the open innovation successfully.

We examine the financial performance and productivity of the companies in period of 1996-2005. We observe how “open innovation” has performed in the stock markets and how the adoption of the different form of the open innovation has effected on the R{\&}D investments and the productivity of patents during the examination period. In addition, companies are also compared with each other. Conclusion of the study is that best practitioners of the open innovation have outperformed on stock markets by creating wealth from investments in innovation activities.},

@techreport{uls,
  abstract = {What are ULS systems?

The U. S. Department of Defense (DoD) has a goal of information dominance—to achieve and exploit superior collection, fusion, analysis, and use of information to meet mission objectives. This goal depends on increasingly complex systems characterized by thousands of platforms, sensors, decision nodes, weapons, and warfighters connected through heterogeneous wired and wireless networks. These systems will push far beyond the size of today’s systems and systems of systems by every measure: number of lines of code; number of people employing the system for different purposes; amount of data stored, accessed, manipulated, and refined; number of connections and interdependencies among software components; and number of hardware elements. They will be ultra-large-scale (ULS) systems.
How are ULS systems different?

The sheer scale of ULS systems will change everything. ULS systems will necessarily be decentralized in a variety of ways, developed and used by a wide variety of stakeholders with conflicting needs, evolving continuously, and constructed from heterogeneous parts. People will not just be users of a ULS system; they will be elements of the system. Software and hardware failures will be the norm rather than the exception. The acquisition of a ULS system will be simultaneous with its operation and will require new methods for control. These characteristics are beginning to emerge in today’s DoD systems of systems; in ULS systems they will dominate. Consequently, ULS systems will place unprecedented demands on software acquisition, production, deployment, management, documentation, usage, and evolution practices.
Challenges of ULS systems

Fundamental gaps in our current understanding of software and software development at the scale of ULS systems present profound impediments to the technically and economically effective achievement of the DoD goal of deterrence and dominance based on information superiority. These gaps are strategic, not tactical. They are unlikely to be addressed adequately by incremental research within established categories. Rather, we require a broad new conception of both the nature of such systems and new ideas for how to develop them. We will need to look at them differently, not just as systems or systems of systems, but as socio-technical ecosystems. We will face fundamental challenges in the design and evolution, orchestration and control, and monitoring and assessment of ULS systems. These challenges require breakthrough research.
The SEI's ULS research agenda

We propose a ULS systems research agenda for an interdisciplinary portfolio of research in at least the following areas:

    * Human Interaction: involves anthropologists, sociologists, and social scientists conducting detailed socio-technical analyses of user interactions in the field, with the goal of understanding how to construct and evolve such socio-technical systems effectively.
    * Computational Emergence: explores the use of methods and tools based on economics and game theory (e.g., mechanism design) to ensure globally optimal ULS system behavior and explores metaheuristics and digital evolution to augment the cognitive limits of human designers.
    * Design: broadens the traditional technology-centric definition of design to include people and organizations; social, cognitive, and economic considerations; and design structures such as design rules and government policies.
    * Computational Engineering: focuses on evolving the expressiveness of representations to accommodate the semantic diversity of many languages and focuses on providing automated support for computing the evolving behavior of components and their compositions.
    * Adaptive System Infrastructure: investigates integrated development environments and runtime platforms that will support the decentralized nature of ULS systems as well as technologies, methods, and theories that will enable ULS systems to be developed in their deployment environments.
    * Adaptable and Predictable System Quality: focuses on how to maintain quality in a ULS system in the face of continuous change, ongoing failures, and attacks and focuses on how to identify, predict, and control new indicators of system health (akin to the U. S. gross domestic product) that are needed because of the scale of ULS systems.
    * Policy, Acquisition, and Management: focuses on transforming acquisition policies and processes to accommodate the rapid and continuous evolution of ULS systems by treating suppliers and supply chains as intrinsic and essential components of a ULS system.

The proposed research does not supplant current, important software research but rather significantly expands its horizons. Moreover, because we are focused on systems of the future, we have purposely avoided couching our descriptions in terms of today’s technology. The envisioned outcome of the proposed research is a spectrum of technologies and methods for developing these systems of the future, with national-security, economic, and societal benefits that extend far beyond ULS systems themselves.

Though our research agenda does not prescribe a single, definitive roadmap, we offer three structures that suggest ways to cluster and prioritize groups of research areas mapping the research areas and topics to (1) specific DoD missions and required capabilities, (2) DoD research funding types required to support them, and (3) estimates of the relative starting points of the research. These structures can then be used to define one or more roadmaps that could lead to one or more ULS systems research programs or projects.
Recommendations

As a first step, we recommend the funding and establishment of a ULS System Research Startup Initiative, which over the course of the next two years would, among other things,

    * work with others to conduct new basic research in key areas;
    * foster the growth of a community of informed stakeholders and researchers; and
    * formulate and issue an initial Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to attract researchers with proven expertise in the diverse set of disciplines (e.g., software engineering, economics, human factors, cognitive psychology, sociology, systems engineering, and business policy) that are collectively required to meet the challenge of ULS systems.

The United States needs a program that will fund the software research required to sustain ongoing transformations in national defense and achieve the DoD goal of information dominance. The key challenge is the decision to move forward. The ULS System Research Agenda presented in Ultra-Large-Scale Systems: The Software Challenge of the Future provides the starting point for the path ahead.},

  abstract={The open source model is a form of software development with source code that is typically made available to all interested parties. At the core of this process is a decentralized production process: open source software development is done by a network of unpaid software developers. Using data from Sourceforge.net, the largest repository of Open Source Software (OSS) projects and contributors on the Internet, we construct two related networks: A Project network and a Contributor network. Knowledge spillovers may be closely related to the structure of such networks, since contributors who work on several projects likely exchange information and knowledge. Defining the number of downloads as output we finds that (i) additional contributors are associated with an increase in output, but that additional contributors to projects in the giant component are associated with greater output gains than additional contributors to projects outside of the giant component; (ii) Betweenness centrality of the project is positively associated with the number of downloads. (iii) Closeness centrality of the project appears also to be positively associated with downloads, but the effect is not statistically significant over all specifications. (iv) Controlling for the correlation between these two measures of centrality (betweenness and closeness), the degree is not positively associated with the number of downloads. (v) The average closeness centrality of the contributors that participated in a project is positively correlated with the success of the project. These results suggest that there are positive spillovers of knowledge for projects occupying critical junctures in the information flow. When we define projects as connected if and only if they had at least two contributors in common, we again find that additional contributors are associated with an increase in output, and again find that this increase is much higher for projects with strong ties than other projects in the giant },

For example, cultural, project management and communication dif-ficulties continually cause problems for software engineers and project man-agers.  While the implementation of efficient software processes can be used to improve the quality of the software product, published software process models do not cater explicitly for the recent growth in global software engi-neering.   Our thesis is that global software engineering factors should be in-cluded in software process models to ensure their continued usefulness in global organisations.  We have developed a software process, Global Teaming, which includes specific practices and sub-practices.  Our purpose is to ensure that requirements for successful global software engineering are stipulated so that organisations can ensure successful implementation of global software engineering.}

  abstract = {In 2004 the concept of evidence-based software engineering (EBSE) was introduced at the ICSE04 conference. This study assesses the impact of systematic literature reviews (SLRs) which are the recommended EBSE method for aggregating evidence. We used the standard systematic literature review method employing a manual search of 10 journals and 4 conference proceedings. Of 20 relevant studies, eight addressed research trends rather than technique evaluation. Seven SLRs addressed cost estimation. The quality of SLRs was fair with only three scoring less than 2 out of 4. Currently, the topic areas covered by SLRs are limited. European researchers, particularly those at the Simula Laboratory appear to be the leading exponents of systematic literature reviews. The series of cost estimation SLRs demonstrate the potential value of EBSE for synthesising evidence and making it available to practitioners.},

	Abstract = {The Coming of Globalization provides the basic context for understanding what globalization means for human society in the contemporary world. It first describes the underlying processes which have led to economic, political and cultural globalization and then sets out the present stage in the evolution of these processes in three vital areas: global capitalism and global markets; the changing relationship between national governments and their peoples; and the conduct of global international relationships. The author concludes by discussing some likely outcomes, both good and bad. 

Argues that globalization has its foundations in the industrial revolution.

p. 2
'Globalization is the latest stage in a long accumulation of technological advance which has given human beings the ability to conduct their affairs across the world without reference to nationality, government authority, time of day or physical environment. These activities may be commercial, financial, religious, cultural, social or political; nothing is barred. Technological advances in global communications have made globalization possible; while the fact of globalization itself is to be seen in the contemporary surge in human activities conducated globally. The effects of these activities on the whole range of humanity's expectations, systems and structures have been and are a heady mixture: they have come and keep coming in different paces in different places; sometimes they create entirely new significant structures; sometime they share them with older systems and structures; sometimes they induce adaptation but sometimes they erode and destroy.

Globalization has happened because technological advances have broken down many phyiscal barriers to worldwide communication which used to limit how much connected or cooperative activity of any kind could happen over long distances. The communications revolution is the result of the cause of globalization. T he result of these technological advances has been a huge increase in human activities carried on without hindrance across the world; and these consequences are also often described as globalization. Thus globalization has come to mean both an ongoing process and a contemporary condition, the result of that process. 

p. 3
Technological advances in communications have accelerated steadily since the early nineteenth century. There were earlier and important improvements. So technological improvements have always been important. But the age of of continuous and rapid development in communications did not start, however, until the Industrial Revolution had accomplished its first stage in Great Britain and the age of steam had truly begun. Thereafter, three stages of development followed. The first was the longest and flowed from the combined effects of of applying the steam engine to land and sea transport and the invention and installation worldwide of the electric telegraph. The second, which began during the Second World War, was also a combination. The perfecting of rocket propulsion led to the ability to launch orbiting satellites. This, when there were enough of them and when combined with thre previous invention of the telephone, gave a global and reliable communications coverage. The role of the telephone is hiterto somewhat restricted to a short or at best medium distance use, was thus transformed into the major communications channel. The third stage, following rapidly in the 1970s, applied the computer, itself transformed in speed, volume and efficiency by the evolution of the microchip, as both manager and transmitter of the system. The Innternet was the result.

Change from vertical organizational structures to horizontal ones as a result of globalization.

	knowledge creation and sharing in these networks. Yet, though conceptually
	appealing, trust is an elusive concept that is often difficult for

	context develops. Based on this work, we summarize behaviors (e.g.,
	discretion, consistency, collaboration) and practices (e.g., building
	shared vision, ensuring transparency in decision-making, holding
	people accountable for trust) for managers interested in promoting
	trust (and thereby knowledge creation and sharing) within their own

@article{Allen2007,
	Abstract = {The existence of informal social networks within organizations has
	long been recognized as important and the unique working relationships
	among scientific and technical personnel have been well documented
	by both academics and practitioners. The growing interest in knowledge
	management practices has led to increased attention being paid to
	social network analysis as a tool for mapping the nature and membership
	of informal networks. However, despite the knowledge-intensive nature
	of research and development (R&D) activities, social network analyses
	of the R&D function remain relatively rare. This paper discusses
	the role of informal networks in the development, exchange and dissemination
	of knowledge within the R&D function. A case study using social network
	analysis is used to compare and contrast formal and informal knowledge
	networks within ICI. Marked differences between the informal organization
	and ICI's formal structures for knowledge exchange are revealed and
	a series of insights into the working habits of technical staff are
	presented. The implications for managers are clear: through a better
	understanding of the informal organization of R&D staff, they can
	more successfully capture and exploit new ideas; more efficiently
	disseminate information throughout the function; and more effectively
	understand the working habits and activities of employees.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: This paper engages with the recent turn in the social sciences
	towards communities of practice as a driver of learning and knowledge
	generation across a variety of different working environments. While
	agreeing with the broad reinstatement of situated social practice
	in thinking on the dynamics of knowledge capitalism, the paper takes
	issue with the increasingly homogeneous and instrumentalist use of
	the term communities of practice to encapsulate knowing in action.
	On the basis of an extensive review of the available literature,
	the paper argues for the importance of differentiating between different
	varieties of knowing in action. The paper notes the differences in
	organisation, spatial dynamics, innovation outcomes, and knowledge
	processes between four modes: craft or task-based knowing; epistemic
	or high creativity knowing; professional knowing; and virtual knowing.
	The proposed typology is used to illustrate the insight gained from
	such analytical precision, through a discussion of the spatial configuration
	of knowing in action, long assumed to require spatial proximity.
	It is shown that spatial and relational proximity which can be struck
	at a distance should not be treated as one and the same.},

	It was assumed that such factors as degree of collectivism, competitiveness,

	modes, would explain differences in knowledge seeking and sharing

	The issue of saving face was less important than expected in China.
	Modesty requirements as well as a high degree of competitiveness

	Abstract = {This article addresses the emergence of networks of practice and the
	role of knowledge sharing via knowledge portals. Its focus is on
	factors that stimulate the successful emergence of networks of practice.
	Literature on knowledge management and communities of practice suggest
	the pre-existence of shared knowledge or a shared belief system as
	a condition sine qua non for the networks of practice to emerge.
	We challenge this assumption and argue and demonstrate that common
	knowledge and belief systems are rather a result of knowledge sharing
	rather than a pre-condition. The central question is how a knowledge
	portal facilitates the diffusion of knowledge among rather loosely
	coupled and often disconnected innovation projects. Research is carried
	out in the agricultural industry in The Netherlands. In this industry
	there is a need to change from a product-oriented to a problem-oriented
	innovation structure. The set up of a platform and knowledge portal
	around agro-logistics - crossing different product-oriented production
	clusters - was therefore a logical result. It gave the opportunity
	to analyze what the impact of a knowledge portal is in a situation
	where people and projects come from different organizations and do
	not know each other. Do they start to share knowledge and what are
	the conditions? With regard to the case study of the knowledge portal
	in the agricultural industry we conclude that a knowledge portal
	will have an impact on how projects are sharing knowledge and on
	the emergence of a network of practice. The results show that pre-conditions
	for the emergence of a network of practice are a sense of urgency
	and fragmented awareness. These results also indicate the important
	role of a knowledge broker. The developed knowledge portal seems
	to lead to overcoming structural holes and a closer cognitive distance
	among the projects. However, we did not find a direct effect of the
	knowledge portal on sharing tacit knowledge. In the initial phase
	of a network of practice the knowledge exchange seems to focus on
	general, non-project specific and explicit knowledge. There was also
	no direct effect of the knowledge portal on the reciprocity of knowledge
	exchange among the projects. However, knowledge was shared between
	the project level and the platform and public level. Conclusions
	and directions for future research are formulated.},

@article{Bogenrieder2004,
	Abstract = {This article attempts to unpack the notion of 'communities of practice',
	in more detail than has been done before, and looks more generally
	at intra-organizational groups for learning. First, it gives a theoretical
	analysis of the relevant characteristics of learning groups which
	affect the possibilities and conditions for the sharing and joint
	development of knowledge. These characteristics include opportunities
	for learning (on the 'competence' side of relations), relational
	risk (on the 'governance' side of relations), and the effects on
	both from the 'structural features' of groups. On the competence
	side, it analyses the implications of different types of knowledge
	and learning, and the trade-off between stability of relations (for
	the sake of mutual understanding and trust) and flexibility of relations
	(for the sake of variety as a source of learning). On the structural
	side, it considers the effects on competence and governance of network
	density, the strength of ties, structural holes, and stability of
	group membership. On the governance side, it considers psychological
	risk, in loss of reputation or legitimation, career risk and risk
	of competition, and risk of lock-in into the group. Trust yields
	one basis for dealing with such risks, and the article discusses
	what that means and how trust develops. Next, the analysis is used
	in an exploratory empirical study of a consultancy company, to see
	if the theoretical framework can explain the occurrence, structure,
	functioning, and performance of learning groups found in practice.},

	Abstract = {While the recent focus on knowledge has undoubtedly benefited organizational
	studies, the literature still presents a sharply contrasting and
	even contradictory view of knowledge, which at times is described
	as "sticky" and at other times "leaky." This paper is written on
	the premise that there is more than a problem with metaphors at issue
	here, and more than accounts of different types of knowledge (such
	as "tacit" and "explicit") can readily explain. Rather, these contrary
	descriptions of knowledge reflect different, partial, and sometimes
	' 'balkanized'' perspectives from which knowledge and organization
	are viewed. Taking the community of practice as a unifying unit of
	analysis for understanding knowledge in the firm, the paper suggests
	that often too much attention is paid to the idea of community, too
	little to the implications of practice. Practice, we suggest, creates
	epistemic differences among the communities within a firm, and the
	firm's advantage over the market lies in dynamically coordinating
	the knowledge produced by these communities despite such differences.
	In making this argument, we argue that analyses of systemic innovation
	should be extended to embrace all firms in a knowledge economy, not
	just the classically innovative. This extension will call for a transformation
	of conventional ideas coordination and of the trade-off between exploration

	Abstract = {With accelerated market volatility, faster response times and increased
	globalization, business environments are going through a major transformation
	and firms have intensified their search for strategies which can
	give them competitive advantage. This requires that companies continuously
	innovate, to think of new ideas that can be transformed into products,
	processes or services, generating value for the firm. Innovative
	solutions and processes are usually developed by a group of people,
	working together. A grouping of people that share and create new
	knowledge can be considered as a Community of Practice (CoP). CoPs
	are places which provide a sound basis for organizational learning
	and encourage knowledge creation and acquisition. Virtual Communities
	of Practice (VCoPs) can perform a central role in promoting communication
	and collaboration between members who are dispersed in both time
	and space. Nevertheless, it is known that not all CoPs and VCoPs
	share the same levels of performance or produce the same results.
	This means that there are factors that enable or constrain the process
	of knowledge creation. With this in mind, we developed a case study
	in order to identify both the motivations and the constraints that
	members of an organization experience when taking part in the knowledge
	creating processes of VCoPs. Results show that organizational culture
	and professional and personal development play important roles in
	these processes. No interviewee mentioned direct financial reward
	as a motivation factor for participation in VCoPs. Most identified
	the difficulty in aligning objectives, established by the management,
	with justification of the time spent in the VCoP. The interviewees
	also said that technology is not a constraint.},

	Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to put forward a model to map
	the evolution of a business Community of Practice (CoP) in terms
	of learning and knowledge management processes. Design/methodology/approach
	- Empirical evidence is based on seven case studies and the analyses
	of three best practices from secondary sources. Two of those cases
	are analyzed longitudinally from inception, while the others are
	retrospective. Cases were chosen in order to cover different kinds
	of industries and, especially, to analyze sharing of different kinds
	of knowledge (from call-centre operators to complex new products
	knowledge). Findings - The article sheds light on the different evolutionary
	paths that business CoPs follow and the role of the dynamics of the
	organizational commitment and the people involvement. It was noticed
	that a high level of commitment from both the organization and its
	members is related to the effectiveness of the Community in supporting
	learning and knowledge management processes. Research limitations/implications
	- The case studies and best practice examples reported are all based
	on the experiences of Western companies - although some, if not all,
	may have global operations. It is possible that some of the conclusions
	(e.g, levels of organizational commitment and individual participation,
	evolutionary stages and drivers), may not be valid for Asian-headquartered
	companies. Practical implications - This article aims to develop
	actionable knowledge to support management in understanding how to
	manage a business CoP, in order to create value for both the organization
	and its members. The proposed model can be used for mapping the CoP
	evolution, while identifying the appropriate governance tools to
	cultivate, stimulate and drive the Community evolution. Originality/value
	- In the model, the evolution of a Community has been assessed in
	terms of its vitality - i.e. its effectiveness in supporting knowledge
	management and learning. This vitality depends on the combination
	of the organization's commitment and members' involvement. Therefore,
	supporting a Community in its evolution means stimulating and maintaining
	the commitment (animation and promotions levers) of these two parties.},

	Abstract = {This paper is a comparative review of four seminal works on communities
	of practice. It is argued that the ambiguities of the terms community
	and practice are a source of the concept's reusability allowing it
	to be reappropriated for different purposes, academic and practical.
	However, it is potentially confusing that the works differ so markedly
	in their conceptualizations of community, learning, power and change,
	diversity and informality. The three earlier works are underpinned
	by a common epistemological view, but Lave and Wenger's 1991 short
	monograph is often read as primarily about the socialization of newcomers
	into knowledge by a form of apprenticeship, while the focus in Brown
	and Duguid's article of the same year is, in contrast, on improvising
	new knowledge in an interstitial group that forms in resistance to
	management. Wenger's 1998 book treats communities of practice as
	the informal relations and understandings that develop in mutual
	engagement on an appropriated joint enterprise, but his focus is
	the impact on individual identity. The applicability of the concept
	to the heavily individualized and tightly managed work of the twenty-first
	century is questionable. The most recent work by Wenger - this time
	with McDermott and Snyder as co-authors - marks a distinct shift
	towards a managerialist stance. The proposition that managers should
	foster informal horizontal groups across organizational boundaries
	is in fact a fundamental redefinition of the concept. However it
	does identify a plausible, if limited, knowledge management (KM)
	tool. This paper discusses different interpretations of the idea
	of {\^a}‚Ç¨Àúco-ordinating{\^a}‚Ç¨{\texttrademark} communities of practice as a management ideology

	within Communities of Practice. It has been argued that trust can
	be viewed as an organizing principle (McEvily, Perrone, and Zaheer,
	2003). However, the focus of this paper is on the view that trust
	is an essential pre-condition for the sharing of knowledge. The goal
	of the paper is to discuss possible connections between social networking
	principles, network structure, and trust within Communities of Practice.
	This paper will define and subsequently analyze the concept of trust
	and develop arguments relating to the existence and strength of trusting
	relationships within Communities of Practice. The theoretical arguments
	propose relationships between the characteristics of trusting relationships
	and four network characteristics: homophily; closure; brokerage;
	and the small-world problem. The general research question that underpins
	this paper is: To what extent do network principles determine the
	level of trust among members within a social network (i.e. a Community
	of Practice)? The analysis focuses on a specific type of social network
	which has been termed a Community of Practice. Communities of Practice
	have been argued to be critical elements in the creation, refinement

	Abstract = {Situated learning theory offers a radical critique of cognitivist
	theories of learning, emphasizing the relational aspects of learning
	within communities of practice in contrast to the individualist assumptions
	of conventional theories. However, although many researchers have
	embraced the theoretical strength of situated learning theory, conceptual
	issues remain undeveloped in the literature. Roberts, for example,
	argues in this issue that the notion of 'communities of practice'--a
	core concept in situated learning theory--is itself problematic.
	To complement her discussion, this paper explores the communities
	of practice concept from several perspectives. Firstly, we consider
	the perspective of the individual learner, and examine the processes
	which constitute 'situated learning.' Secondly, we consider the broader
	socio-cultural context in which communities of practice are embedded.
	We argue that the cultural richness of this broader context generates
	a fluidity and heterogeneity within and beyond communities. Finally,
	we argue that it is sometimes difficult to distinguish conceptually
	between the terms 'participation' and 'practice' because of occasional
	duplication of meaning. We propose, instead, a refinement of the
	definition to allow for greater conceptual clarity.},

	Abstract = {This paper introduces the concept of knowledge networks to explain
	why some business units are able to benefit from knowledge residing

	of this concept is that a proper understanding of effective interunit
	knowledge sharing in a multiunit firm requires a joint consideration
	of relatedness in knowledge content among business units and the
	network of lateral interunit relations that enables task units to
	access related knowledge. Results from a study of 120 new product
	development projects in 41 business units of a large multiunit electronics
	company showed that project teams obtained more existing knowledge
	from other units and completed their projects faster to the extent
	that they had short interunit network paths to units that possessed
	related knowledge. In contrast, neither network connections nor extent
	of related knowledge alone explained the amount of knowledge obtained
	and project completion time. The results also showed a contingent
	effect of having direct interunit relations in knowledge networks:
	While established direct relations mitigated problems of transferring
	noncodified knowledge, they were harmful when the knowledge to be
	transferred was codified, because they were less needed but still
	involved maintenance costs. These findings suggest that research
	on knowledge transfers and synergies in multiunit firms should pursue

	Abstract = {A critical component of Knowledge Management is creating mechanisms
	to facilitate collaboration and sharing of information. One such
	mechanism of increasing popularity is Communities of Practice (CP).
	This article presents the results of an empirical study that explored
	the impact of select CP characteristics on overall community effectiveness
	and community members' satisfaction with their community experience.
	The CP characteristics examined in the study include community's
	leadership quality, CP members' affective commitment to the community
	and its goals, members' perceived connectedness with others in the
	community, trust among CP members, and perceived impact of CP involvement
	on members' own jobs. The data for this study were collected at State
	Farm Insurance Companies. State Farm is the largest property and
	casualty insurance company in the United States. Recognizing the
	need for better Knowledge Management and greater connectivity among
	its decentralized structure of 13 zone offices, more than 300 claim
	offices and contact centers, and 17,000 agents, the company launched
	a Knowledge Management initiative. The centerpiece of this initiative
	has been a network of CPs with a focus on encouraging information
	sharing, collaborative problem solving, and sharing best practices.
	To collect the data for this study, anonymous surveys were sent to
	the entire population of 579 employees who were participating in
	the company's CP network. Of these surveys, 204 were completed and
	returned, representing a 37% response rate. The study results for
	the most part supported the hypothesized relationships regarding
	determinants of CP effectiveness.},

	Abstract = {This paper derives from a longitudinal study conducted in a multinational
	company. Through an interpretive case study approach, we have explored
	the phenomenon of knowledge networking in distributed work. More
	specifically, we have focused on the evolution patterns in a particular
	knowledge networking structure denoted as distributed networks of
	practice. The paper conceptualizes this kind of network of practice
	as an information and communication technology (ICT) facilitated
	dynamic relationship of participants that are geographically and
	temporally dispersed from one another, and who are sharing and creating
	knowledge related to their daily work practices and business problems.
	Three different categories of networks were identified 1) problem
	solving networks, 2) business improvement networks, and 3) innovation
	networks. Findings demonstrate that the networks evolved differently
	over time, and the study identified four distinct evolution patterns
	comprising 1) devolution in terms of short life cycle and dissolution,
	2) recursive patterns where new ad-hoc networks emerged from the
	mother network, 3) integration of knowledge practices through cross-network
	proposals, and 4) innovation and expansion in scope and size. While
	previous studies have suggested fixed models for how a life cycle
	of a community takes place, this study however identified four dissimilar
	evolution patterns. Thus, these findings challenge life cycles models
	suggested in traditional community of practice research. The paper
	utilizes an information infrastructure perspective to provide an
	improved understanding of the evolution patterns within these networks
	by viewing them as ecological social structures facilitated by a
	technological infrastructure. Through social lines of practice and
	effective knowledge sharing, the participants created an infrastructure
	of knowing within the organization and managed to alter organizational
	practices through evolution. The paper illustrates how a knowledge
	networking structure as such may facilitate distributed work practices
	and knowledge activities across temporal and spatial boundaries.},

@article{Hustad2007a,
	Abstract = {This paper reports from an interpretive case study conducted in a
	multinational company that operates in the marine insurance industry.
	The study focuses on how structural diversity influences knowledge
	work activities performed by participants who are members of distributed
	networks of practice (DNoPs). In this paper, a DNoP is defined as
	a loosely knit, geographically dispersed group of participants who
	share knowledge with the purpose of solving business problems and
	improve daily work practices within an organization. The paper takes
	the view that dimensions of structural diversity such as geographical
	dispersion, business functions and business divisions define internal
	organizational boundaries. Thus, knowledge sharing in structurally
	diverse networks may be less efficient due to the barriers that these
	internal boundaries may cause. Structural diversity, however, may
	also enhance creativity and innovation where radical new insights
	arise from different perspectives introduced by the participants.
	Consequently, diversity and its potential boundaries embed a duality
	of contradictory features. The interviewees who participated in this
	study regarded diversity as a valuable resource. Different perceptions
	of business concepts, however, caused misunderstanding and conflicts
	between participants who worked at different business divisions and
	thus were geographically dispersed. Interesting findings demonstrated
	that the DNoPs under study went through an evolution where participants
	enacted through boundary spanning activities to overcome the barriers
	that structural diversity caused. The role of knowledge brokers and
	the use of boundary objects were crucial in these activities. While
	some boundary objects acted as obstacles, unexpected and illogical
	objects emerged from practice and became the most efficient boundary
	objects in use. Different communication media such as video- and
	teleconferences, email and intranet supported the boundary spanning
	processes. This paper brings the insight that networks were transformed
	by the influence of diversity, and that knowledge practices within
	the networks supported a shift as the networks evolved through cross-network
	interactions.},

	Abstract = {This study examines distributed networks of practice in a multinational

	a differentiated view of intra-organizational networks of practice,
	we identified three main categories of intra-organizational distributed
	networks of practice in terms of their primary knowledge activities
	- knowledge sharing, incremental knowledge creation, and radical
	knowledge creation. We then compared the networks along two dimensions:
	1) the degree of diversity among network participants and 2) the
	communication media used by the network participants. Findings suggest
	that a higher degree of diversity is related to a higher degree of
	knowledge creation activities, but too much diversity may be restrictive
	when the primary activity is radical innovation. In addition, media
	use findings indicated an unexpected reverse relationship in which
	networks of practice with high task equivocality used leaner media
	than networks with less task equivocality. The results also indicate
	that the degree of diversity of a network's members may influence
	media use. Finally, support is found for second level media effects
	of media choice within the networks of practice, such as the degree

	their potential development using networked technology and remote
	collaboration, specifically with respect to World Wide Web (WWW)
	communication tools. The vast majority of the current literature
	in this new research area consists of case studies. Communities of
	practice have the following components that distinguish them from
	traditional organizations and learning situations: (1) different
	levels of expertise that are simultaneously present in the community
	of practice; (2) fluid peripheral to center movement that symbolizes
	the progression from being a novice to an expert; and (3) completely
	authentic tasks and communication. Supporting concepts include aspects
	of constructivism (i.e., ill-structured problems, facilitation, collaborative
	learning, and negotiated goals), community knowledge greater than
	individual knowledge, as well as an environment of safety and trust.
	Virtual communities are defined as designed communities using current
	networked technology, whereas communities of practice emerge within
	the designed community via the ways their participants use the designed
	community. Current networked technology has both advantages and disadvantages
	in emergent development of communities of practice. Because most
	collaboration is text-based, norms are reduced, enabling introverted
	participants to share their ideas on an equal footing with extroverts.
	However, the greatest problem with virtual communities is withdrawing,
	or attrition. This problem can be reduced somewhat through good facilitation
	techniques and adequate scaffolding, especially in the cases of online
	communication techniques and technical support. Finally, the author
	recommends further research questions and proposes a case study,

	research in a Swedish public-private partnership, focused on large-scale
	media and entertainment event. In the temporary event-driven project-based

	Abstract = {The purpose of this dissertation is to expand existing knowledge management
	literature by integrating two separate schools of knowledge management
	research---social network analysis and information systems research.
	Although some existing research has begun to integrate these fields,
	a large gap still exists in understanding how networks of people
	interact with other technology-enabled information management capabilities,
	such as databases, to share knowledge. My dissertation examines how
	a network of people interacts with multiple information management
	capabilities to share knowledge. I do so by adopting the concept
	of multimodal networks , defined as the collection of people and
	technology-enabled information management capabilities used to share
	knowledge within an organization (Monge et al. 2003). I conduct a
	multi-method study that explores the nature of and performance implications
	for the distinct features of such networks. Using a grounded theory
	approach, I first develop a theory of knowledge sharing in multimodal
	networks through a qualitative study of six healthcare teams in a
	large healthcare delivery organization. The teams share a common
	task, common performance metrics, and are comprised of roughly the
	same complement of employees and an identical complement of information
	systems. Controlling for network composition and task helps isolate
	the effects of various features of the network configuration of the
	multimodal network. Using this qualitative data, I develop a theoretical
	model of seven hypotheses along three dimensions of the knowledge
	sharing network---the structural dimension, the relational dimension,
	and the cognitive dimension. I then conduct a survey of 40 healthcare
	teams to test the hypotheses generated from my qualitative research.
	In general, I find good support for my seven hypotheses along each
	of the three dimensions of the knowledge sharing network. The most
	consistently significant variable is IS centrality, which simultaneously
	accounts for both the user-system and interpersonal ties to account
	for the importance of information systems in the multimodal network.
	This provides strong support for the importance of the multimodal
	network perspective to study knowledge sharing. I conclude this research

	Abstract = {Electronic networks of practice are computer-mediated social spaces
	in which individuals working on similar problems self-organize to
	help each other and share perspectives. Based on previous research
	positing that the interaction created by network participants produces
	an online public good of knowledge, the purpose of this empirical
	paper is to use theories of public goods and collective action to
	investigate this provision of knowledge. While based on the same
	technology platform and a similar concept, we examine three cases
	in different professions: education, healthcare, and tourism by examining
	how the 1) heterogeneity of the individuals, 2) relational structure
	of social ties, 3) norms of behavior, 4) affective factors, and 5)
	sanctions for noncompliance impact the creation of a public good.
	We find that the most successful effort to create an electronic network
	of practice was within education and that one contributing factor
	was the site's ability to leverage existing offline networks of practice
	to create a relational structure of stronger social ties between
	members. In summary, these results reveal that taking a unitary view
	of the underlying collective masks possible heterogeneity along a
	number of important dimensions and as a result may undermine the
	likelihood that the public good is created and maintained.},

	in studies of social context. Scholars tend only to infer, not identify,

	no problem in groups or small organizations where everyone knows

	the many distant others who populate an individual's social context:
	those known only through company newsletters or office gossip, those
	with whom the individual never has contact, and those who carry little
	immediate salience. Data from a large organization are used to explore

	differences in the composition of close associations compared to

	Lesser and Prusak propose that communities of practice are "formed
	by individuals who need to associate themselves with others facing
	similar issues and challenges within the organization. They exist
	without formal charters or operational mandates." As these informal
	organizations become recognized by organizations, both knowledge
	and human capital can be leveraged. Addressing this potential, Lesser
	and Prusak point to social capital as "the web of social relationships
	that influences individual behavior and thereby affects economic
	growth." The authors propose that communities of practice serve as
	the primary vehicle for building social capital. This is illustrated
	by exploring the structural, relational, and cognitive dimensions
	of communities of practice and their implications for managers attempting
	to bridge the gap between creating, sharing, and applying knowledge.},

	Abstract = {As organizations grow in size, geographical scope, and complexity,

	learning, based on common interests--can improve organizational performance.
	Although many authors assert that communities of practice create
	organizational value, there has been relatively little systematic
	study of the linkage between community outcomes and the underlying
	social mechanisms that are at work. To build an understanding of
	how communities of practice create organizational value, we suggest
	thinking of a community as an engine for the development of social
	capital. We argue that the social capital resident in communities
	of practice leads to behavioral changes, which in turn positively
	influence business performance. We identify four specific performance
	outcomes associated with the communities of practice we studied and
	link these outcomes to the basic dimensions of social capital. These
	dimensions include connections among practitioners who may or may
	not be co-located, relationships that build a sense of trust and
	mutual obligation, and a common language and context that can be
	shared by community members. Our conclusions are based on a study

@article{Lindkvist2005,
	Abstract = {The notion of a 'community-of-practice' (CmP) has become a highly
	influential way of conceptualizing how decentralized sub-units or
	groups within firms or organizations operate. CmPs refer to 'tightly
	knit' groups that have been practising together long enough to develop
	into a cohesive community with relationships of mutuality and shared
	understandings. The CmP notion, however, does not fit squarely with
	how temporary organizations or project organizations operate. Typically
	these kinds of groups consist of diversely skilled individuals, most
	of whom have not met before, who have to solve a problem or carry
	out a pre-specified task within tightly set limits as to time and
	costs. As a result they tend to become less well-developed groups,
	operating on a minimal basis of shared knowledge and understandings.
	Such a group, I suggest, constitutes a 'collectivity-of-practice'
	(ClP). Mirroring the above distinctions, two ideal-type notions of
	epistemology are developed. The one inspired from the CmP literature
	is discussed in a 'knowledge community' terminology, whereas the
	one associated with ClPs is conceived of as a 'knowledge collectivity.'
	Finally, I outline some new options for organizational analysis made
	possible by recognizing these as two different and complementary
	notions.},

	Abstract = {Purpose - This paper proposes defining a methodology of cultivation
	and integration of communities of practices (CoPs) and to create
	an evaluation model in organizations. Design/methodology/approach
	- This research project was based on a qualitative case study design,
	with main units of analysis being CoPs. The objective was achieved
	developing an analysis model of CoPs based on the key dimensions
	created by R. McDermott and studying actual experiences in CoPs integration
	with this model. The reported research project involves 15 organization
	actual experiences of CoPs in very different kinds of organizations.
	Although the study analyzed different kinds of companies, the evaluation
	methodology is unique. Findings - Based on the results of the study,
	a cultivation model of CoPs was created, which includes the detection
	analysis of CoPs in organization, the analysis of CoPs' necessity
	in organizations, the analysis of the appropriate CoPs in each organization
	and the evaluation model for the integrated CoPs. Research limitations/implications
	- All the actual experiences analyzed are documented cases. Therefore,
	it is difficult to find failure experiences and most of them are
	successful cases. Practical implications - The cultivation model
	can help managers of any organization in the integration process
	of CoPs. Originality/value - The main contribution of this project
	is the development of a valid and sustainable cultivation model of

	Abstract = {In large companies, technological knowledge lies dispersed over individual
	specialists, business units and locations. Communities of practice
	(CoPs) are a structure for sharing this dispersed knowledge. However,
	CoPs are usually seen as being emergent, evolving and elusive. This
	study aims to investigate if and how it is possible to purposefully
	create CoPs. This study describes and evaluates the launch of four
	CoPs within Rolls-Royce. A combination of quantitative and qualitative
	methods is used to determine and explain the activities and outcomes
	of the CoPs. Each of the CoPs provided benefits to its members, but
	performance differences were found between the CoPs. Longer existing
	CoPs were more active as the structural elements and dimensions of
	CoPs take time to evolve and become balanced. But more active CoPs
	were not necessarily more beneficial to their members. This is partially
	explained by the degree to which a CoP focuses on local issues. It
	is worthwhile to actively pursue the development of CoPs to manage
	technological knowledge. However, it takes time for CoPs to mature
	and become effective, and they are never fully under managerial control.
	Focusing on local issues increases the direct benefits for community
	members and therewith their commitment to the CoP. This is one of
	the few evaluation studies of CoPs. While literature often assumes
	that CoPs have to emerge, this paper finds that it is also possible
	to purposefully create CoPs.},

@article{Raz2007,
	Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe and analyse the
	formation of CoPs (communities of practice) in three call centres
	of cellular communication operating companies in Israel. Design/methodology/approach
	- This study is based on a qualitative methodology including observations,
	interviews and textual analysis. Findings - In all three call centres,
	customer service representatives (CSRs) turned to each other in order
	to produce situated knowledge that combined compliance with organisational
	procedures alongside subversion so as to increase individual availability
	while compromising professional goals. These CoPs were formed during
	training, on-the-job learning, and off-the-job informal social activities.
	The resentment expressed in these CoPs was found to be related to
	standard HRM policies (low pay, stringent control, lack of career
	prospects) as well as to cultural contradictions involving efficiency
	and service quality, which CSRs had to handle and absorb. Research
	limitations/implications - The research provides ethnographic evidence
	regarding the formation of subversive CoPs in call centres but, as
	with all case study research, the findings cannot be reliably generalised
	to other companies. Similarly, the case generates grounded theory
	that needs to be tested in other organisational contexts. Practical
	implications - The study raises the issue of how CoPs can become
	both enablers and barriers to knowledge flow in the organisation.
	To increase the potential of such CoPs to improve rather than inhibit
	service performance in call centres, practical implications are suggested
	in terms of HRM practices (e.g. strategic segmentation, the modification
	of monitoring), and in openly confronting cultural contradictions.
	Originality/value - The article offers an ethnographic analysis of
	CoPs in call centres, focusing on their formation in the context
	of HRM practices and cultural contradictions, and highlighting their
	potential to constitute subversive workgroup cultures, rather than
	their conventionally perceived functional role in the organisation.
	As an inductive research using covert methods the article offers
	fresh insights in relation to CoPs and counter cultures.},

	the willingness and motivation of individuals to invest time, energy,

	the network range, ties to different knowledge pools, increases a
	person's ability to convey complex ideas to heterogeneous audiences.
	We also examine explanations for knowledge transfer based on absorptive
	capacity, which emphasizes the role of common knowledge, and relational
	embeddedness, which stresses the importance of tie strength. We investigate
	the network effect on knowledge transfer using data from a contract
	R&D firm. The results indicate that both social cohesion and network
	range ease knowledge transfer, over and above the effect for the
	strength of the tie between two people. We discuss the implications

	as they seek to establish ways to maintain relevance and effectiveness
	in the volatile environments in which they work (Thomas et al, 2005).
	When well executed, virtual COPs produce results because the knowledge

	Abstract = {When a set of people are connected by a set of meaningful social relationships
	we talk of a social network. A social network represents a social
	structure and the underlying structural patterns can be used to analyze
	and comprehend how people relate to each other and their emergent
	behavior as a group. Developing software is fundamentally a human
	activity. Developers cooperate and exchange knowledge and information,
	creating in fact, a particular type of social network that we call
	knowledge network. In this paper we investigate knowledge networks
	in software development teams by applying social network analysis
	and we use the Apache web server as a case study. By analyzing the
	structural communication and coordination patterns in Apache we have
	been able to identify the Apache knowledge network, highlight potential
	communication bottlenecks, and find brokers and important coordination
	points in the software development team. Furthermore, our work enables
	a software architect to analyze and maintain the organization and
	the software architecture aligned during software evolution. An important

	an additional tool to be added to the traditional software architecture

	Abstract = {Symbiotic computing leads to a proliferation of computing devices
	that in turn allow linking people, favouring the development of Communities
	of Practice (CoPs). The notion of Communities of Practice is newer
	than the social organization it describes, but the emergence of technologies
	based on the Internet like emails, forums, blogs, wikis, conference
	calls, video-conference facilitated the creation of a new kind of
	CoP: the distributed CoP. Distributed CoPs are CoPs whose members
	being dispersed geographically have to rely strongly on technological
	means to interact. Distributed CoPs face new issues due to the distance
	among members, the size of the community and the cultural differences.
	In this context, coordinating distributed CoPs is even more challenging
	than coordinating their collocated counterparts. Things that happen
	rather spontaneously in a collocated community must be instigated
	in a distributed one, overloading the coordination of distributed
	CoPs. The increasing role of the coordination should be supported
	by an adequate set of coordination tools. In this paper we present
	a tool that aims at supporting the coordination of distributed CoPs.
	This tool lets the coordination follow the evolution of the community.
	It analyzes the exchanges among members and shows this information
	in a graphical format in order to help the coordination to follow
	the evolution of the participation and the domain of the community.},

	Abstract = {{Innovative uses of global and local networks of linked computers
	make new ways of collaborative working, learning, and acting possible.
	In <i>Group Cognition</i> Gerry Stahl explores the technological
	and social reconfigurations that are needed to achieve computer-supported
	collaborative knowledge building--group cognition that transcends
	the limits of individual cognition. Computers can provide active
	media for social group cognition where ideas grow through the interactions
	within groups of people; software functionality can manage group
	discourse that results in shared understandings, new meanings, and
	collaborative learning. Stahl offers software design prototypes,
	analyzes empirical instances of collaboration, and elaborates a theory
	of collaboration that takes the group, rather than the individual,
	as the unit of analysis. <br /> <br /> Stahl's design studies concentrate
	on mechanisms to support group formation, multiple interpretive perspectives,
	and the negotiation of group knowledge in applications as varied
	as collaborative curriculum development by teachers, writing summaries
	by students, and designing space voyages by NASA engineers. His empirical
	analysis shows how, in small-group collaborations, the group constructs
	intersubjective knowledge that emerges from and appears in the discourse
	itself. This discovery of group meaning becomes the springboard for
	Stahl's outline of a social theory of collaborative knowing. Stahl
	also discusses such related issues as the distinction between meaning
	making at the group level and interpretation at the individual level,
	appropriate research methodology, philosophical directions for group
	cognition theory, and suggestions for further empirical work.}},

	through learning, innovation, and knowledge transfer. While similar
	to communities of practice, strategic communities differ in two respects:
	they are created by management to address broad strategic objectives,
	and they are focused around achieving specific goals. In this regard,
	authors Storck and Hill give us an insider's view of Xerox's Transition
	Alliance--a strategic community of fifty IT professionals responsible
	for maintaining 70,000 workstations, 1,200 servers, and the systems
	vital for Xerox's competitive success. Notwithstanding, Storck and
	Hill suggest that strategic communities provide a number of organizational
	benefits: - Higher quality knowledge creation- Fewer surprises and
	revisions in plans- Greater capacity to deal with unstructured problems-
	More effective knowledge sharing among business units and corporate
	staff units- Improved likelihood of implementing joint goal- More
	effective individual development and learning Strategic communities
	provide a means for Xerox to exploit the tacit knowledge of its IT
	professionals while encouraging, rather than mandating, membership.

	This article contributes to these debates on the construction of
	communities of practice and their role in the innovation process.
	It does this through a case study of a radical innovation for the
	treatment of prostate cancer. The case focuses on Medico-the company
	that manufactured a product for the new treatment-and explores attempts
	by managers to construct a new 'community of practice' as a vehicle
	for innovation. While the case highlights attempts by managers to
	construct communities as 'social objects, it also underlines the
	shift in management strategies and practices associated with such
	a construction. Faced with powerful professions, and limited organizational
	support, managers employed a strategy centred on constructing a community
	focused on the disease (rather than the product) using 'community
	of practice' as a rhetorical device to enrol key professionals and
	to mobilize and legitimize changes in work practice. Thus community

	Abstract = {If communities of practice (Lave and Wenger 1991) are best understood
	as fluid social relations, enacted among a self-selected group of
	participants, then are they best left alone, free from "interference"
	by organizational managers and policymakers? Or are there ways in
	which organizations can provide helpful support to such communities,
	without constraining the delicate dynamic by which they are sustained?
	This paper supports the latter position, arguing that organizations
	should sponsor the creation of certain loose organizational structures,
	around which it is hoped that communities of practice may then interact.
	However, some recent empirical research is presented suggesting that
	attempts to control group interaction by introducing too much structure
	are likely to result in the demise of the community itself. It is
	therefore proposed that there are lower and upper parameters for
	structural intervention in communities of practice. It is suggested
	that such communities also have epistemic parameters, where participants'
	willingness to express their ideas as conceptual boundary objects
	around which others may engage and develop ideas is a minimum requirement,
	but where too much inward communicative focus is likely to result
	in gradual loss of meaning, with a negative effect on the community.
	In developing this position, this paper attempts to deepen our theoretical
	understanding of the interrelationship between organizational structure
	and the epistemic activity of members of communities of practice.
	Several practical implications of these insights are discussed for
	organizations wishing to cultivate and maintain communities of practice
	within their own working environments.},

	Abstract = {This dissertation explores the performance implications of "knowledge
	communities," refining a methodology for identifying these communities,
	and developing a theoretical framework to further understand this
	aspect of innovation and new knowledge creation. Research on innovation
	and performance often takes either firms or research institutions
	as the primary unit of analysis or contrasts firms to traditional
	communities (Chen, McCain, White, &amp; Lin, 2002; Gittelman, 2003;
	Hargens, 2000a; Podolny &amp; Stuart, 1995). In our study of innovation
	and performance we take informal inter-organizational communities
	of knowledge creators as our unit of analysis and contrast these
	communities to firms to understand how in this context innovation
	and performance happen and can be best promoted. In the first paper
	we examine knowledge communities from the bottom up---how and why
	do individual researchers join and collaborate within such communities.
	Using a zero-inflated negative binomial model, we find that these
	communities can confer significant advantages to researchers. We
	study how researchers' positions within and between knowledge communities
	can influence the impact of their work. In the second paper we look
	at knowledge communities themselves in order to try to understand
	why they experience differential success. We use a GLS approach to
	examine how knowledge communities build on prior knowledge and how
	they use rhetoric in terms of flexibility, uniqueness and cohesiveness.
	Knowledge communities, we argue, are a kind of inter-organizational
	organizational form that can have sustained and meaningful characteristics
	for performance but has been largely overlooked by the strategic
	and organizational literature. In our last essay we use qualitative
	and quantitative methods to explore potential antecedents to knowledge
	communities---research fronts. By looking at the highly cited "hot"
	areas of science and seeing whether they maximize growth in size
	or impact, we are able to develop some insights into how science
	evolves and changes both in structure and content.},

@article{Usoro2007,
	Abstract = {This study focusses on the role of trust in knowledge sharing within
	the context of virtual communities of practice. Trust is widely accepted
	as an important enabler of knowledge management (KM) processes. We
	conceptualise trust across three dimensions, namely: competence,
	integrity and benevolence; we test hypotheses as to the effect of
	these facets of trust on knowledge sharing by surveying an intra-organisational
	global virtual community of practitioners. The results indicate that
	all three dimensions of trust are positively related to knowledge-sharing
	behaviour. Trust based on the perceived integrity of the community
	was found to be the strongest predictor of knowledge-sharing behaviour.
	Our findings suggest that the dimensions of trust buttress each other;
	although they are theoretically distinct, they appear to be empirically
	inseparable. We propose that in order for knowledge sharing to be
	enabled, trust must concurrently exist in all three dimensions. Implication
	to organisations in their recruitment policy is to include competence,
	integrity and benevolence in their sought-for attributes of new employees.
	KM practitioners also have to encourage these attributes in existing
	employees, who are potential members of on-line communities of practice.
	Knowledge sharing itself was conceptualised with three components
	- quantity (frequency), quality (usefulness or value) and focus (the
	degree to which an individual feels that they engage in knowledge
	sharing). Of the three components, focus exhibits the most significant
	relationship with trust factors. This finding makes knowledge sharing
	less tangible than perhaps would be expected. It suggests that establishing
	whether knowledge has been shared is more than counting the frequency
	or trying to evaluate the usefulness of the shared knowledge. These
	aspects are important especially to management, but to the individual
	who shares knowledge, her feelings of having shared knowledge appear
	to be more important. With the current understanding that knowledge
	sharing is more of a human activity than technology, it is important
	that any information system should be assistive in boosting users'
	confidence that they are indeed sharing knowledge. If the systems
	do not re-enforce the users' knowledge-sharing orientation, knowledge
	sharing may be discouraged. Notwithstanding the point made about
	knowledge-sharing focus, it is necessary to take into consideration
	all the components of knowledge sharing to fully capture the concept.
	This was well indicated when the combined variable of all (rather
	than individual) knowledge-sharing items had the strongest correlation
	with trust factors.},

	Abstract = {The recently developed knowledge-based view of the firm argues that
	knowledge is the firm's most valuable resource. Within this field
	of study, informal social networks are rapidly gaining attention
	as mechanisms that facilitate knowledge flows. Electronic networks
	of practice (NoPs) are a special case of informal network where the
	sharing of practice-related knowledge occurs primarily through computer-based
	communication technologies. However, we know relatively little about
	the dynamics of knowledge exchange that occur in these electronic
	networks. This conceptual paper posits that there is a relationship
	between the structural properties of electronic NoPs and successful
	knowledge exchange. The theoretical positions of social network theory
	and the knowledge-based view of the firm are used to support this
	claim. A review of the extant literature reveals that a clear conceptual
	framework for NoPs is lacking. The objective of this research is
	to contribute to the development of such a framework by addressing
	a largely neglected area within the growing network of practice literature
	namely, the relationship between electronic network communication
	structure and knowledge flows.},

	abstract = {The perspective of modeling knowledge in Artificial Intelligence is that these models are equal to the knowledge itself (e.g. equate the map with the territory). This encoding view treats knowledge as if it were primarily verbal and assumes that verbal concepts themselves can be replaced by descriptions of concepts{}as if a body of descriptions and neural categorizations were equivalent mechanisms for generating behavior.[ ] This paper describes a number of concepts around the notion of {}situatedness: situated cognition, situated action, situated learning, and the concept of autopoiesis as an organizing principle. Situatedness changes the way we think about how knowledge is created (learning) and applied (action). In this light knowledge management changes its meaning from managing the knowledge of an organization to managing the situation in which learning happens. Collaboration and participation become the key management principles. In this paper we propose that Brahms (Business Re-design Agent-based Holistic Modeling System), an activity-based multi-agent modeling environment, allows us to model knowledge in situated actions and learning in human activities.},

	abstract = {This special issue of Janus Head explores a number of disciplinary and interdisciplinary dimensions of the theme, the situated body. The body, of course, is always situated in so far as it is a living and experiencing body. Being situated in this sense is different from simply being located someplace in the way a non-living, non-experiencing object is located. That the body is always situated involves certain kinds of physical and social interactions, and it means that experience is always both physically and socially situated. The interesting question is not only how this works (what precisely it means to be situated), but whether and how the answer to that question changes from one situation to another. It seems reasonable to say that the body is situated differently in different situations, and that this difference may not be simply a difference in the situational content but a difference in how the body processes being situated precisely because the circumstances are so different. The question is not just about differences in situations, but differences in situatedness. Is it possible that the body is X-situated (in terms of its situatedness) in the task of solving a mathematical problem, but is Y-situated when it is engaged in dancing with another person? And if, as seems obvious, there are signi{}cant physiological and experiential differences involved in being in these different situations, are some of these differences due to being X-situated, for example, rather than Y-situated? This collection of essays gathers together investigations of the situated body that address such variations in what it means to be situated. These investigations cross theory and practice, expression and performance and interweave disciplines and practices such as philosophical anthropology, cognitive science, phenomenology, architecture and painting, and artistic performances like dance and music. They describe the body as an experiencing enactive agent embedded in various pragmatic and social circumstances, the body as rigidly circumscribed in art and science, and the body as extended into its environment through the high technology that is more and more defining our experiences and our relationships..},

  abstract = {The paper proposes a more formalized definition of UML 2.0 Activity Diagram
semantics. A subset of activity diagram constructs relevant for business
process modeling is considered. The semantics definition is based on the
original token flow methodology, but a more constructive approach is used. The
Activity Diagram Virtual machine is defined by means of a metamodel, with
operations defined by a mix of pseudocode and OCL pre- and postconditions. A
formal procedure is described which builds the virtual machine for any activity
diagram. The relatively complicated original token movement rules in control
nodes and edges are combined into paths from an action to action. A new
approach is the use of different (push and pull) engines, which move tokens
along the paths. Pull engines are used for paths containing join nodes, where
the movement of several tokens must be coordinated. The proposed virtual
machine approach makes the activity semantics definition more transparent where
the token movement can be easily traced. However, the main benefit of the
approach is the possibility to use the defined virtual machine as a basis for
UML activity diagram based workflow or simulation engine.},

  abstract = {The governance of natural resources used by many individuals in common is an issue of increasing concern to policy analysts. Both state control and privatisation of resources have been advocated, but neither the state nor the market have been uniformly successful in solving common pool resource problems. Offering a critique of the foundations of policy analysis as applied to natural resources, Elinor Ostrom here provides a unique body of empirical data to explore conditions under which common pool resource problems have been satisfactorily or unsatisfactorily solved. Dr Ostrom first describes three models most frequently used as the foundation for recommending state or market solutions. She then outlines theoretical and empirical alternatives to these models in order to illustrate the diversity of possible solutions. In the following chapters she uses institutional analysis to examine different ways - both successful and unsuccessful - of governing the commons. In contrast to the proposition of the tragedy of the commons argument, common pool problems sometimes are solved by voluntary organisations rather than by a coercive state. Among the cases considered are communal tenure in meadows and forests, irrigation communities and other water rights, and fisheries.},

  abstract = {Gamma is a programming model in which computation can be seen as chemical
	reactions between data represented as molecules floating in a chemical
	solution. This model can be formalised as associative, commutative,
	conditional rewritings of multisets where rewrite rules and multisets
	represent chemical reactions and solutions, respectively. In this
	article we generalise the notion of multiset used by Gamma and present
	applications through various programming examples. First, multisets
	are generalised to include rewrite rules, which become first-class
	citizens. This extension is formalised by the \${\textbackslash}gamma\$-calculus,
	which is a chemical model that summarises in a few rules the essence
	of higher-order chemical programming. By extending the \${\textbackslash}gamma\$-calculus
	with constants, operators, types and expressive patterns, we build
	a higher-order chemical programming language called {HOCL.} Finally,
	multisets are further generalised by allowing elements to have infinite
	and negative multiplicities. Semantics, implementation and applications
	of this extension are considered.}

	has not investigated top management's involvement in detail. The
	purpose of this paper is to present three detailed and successful
	mechanisms through which top management contributes to the guidance
	of Cops. Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents an investigation
	of 47 CoPs conducted in several organizations. Data collection was
	achieved using a qualitative questionnaire, followed by in-depth
	interviews with leaders of CoPs. Findings - This study explored three
	mechanisms used by sponsors to successfully guide CoPs. More specifically,
	the findings highlight a set of operational means used by top management
	- via sponsors to supervise and facilitate best practice development
	and sharing within CoPs. Research limitations/implications - The
	CoPs should be examined by means of an ethnological approach, thus
	interacting with many members of the same CoP to gain an in-depth-understanding
	of each mechanisms significance for the sponsorship 3 success. There
	is also a need to further explore how the three sponsorship mechanisms
	are interrelated. Originality/value - Through numerous examples extracted
	from different multinational organizations, this paper offers clear
	guidelines for top managers on how to improve their support to CoPs
	in their organization.},

	(ATAM), Software Architecture Analysis Method (SAAM), and Active

  abstract = {Effective work groups engage in external knowledge sharing--the exchange
	of information, know-how, and feedback with customers, organizational
	experts, and others outside of the group. This paper argues that
	the value of external knowledge sharing increases when work groups
	are more structurally diverse. A structurally diverse work group
	is one in which the members, by virtue of their different organizational
	affiliations, roles, or positions, can expose the group to unique
	sources of knowledge. It is hypothesized that if members of structurally
	diverse work groups engage in external knowledge sharing, their performance
	will improve because of this active exchange of knowledge through
	unique external sources. A field study of 182 work groups in a Fortune
	500 telecommunications firm operationalizes structural diversity
	as member differences in geographic locations, functional assignments,
	reporting managers, and business units, as indicated by corporate
	database records. External knowledge sharing was measured with group
	member surveys and performance was assessed using senior executive
	ratings. Ordered logit analyses showed that external knowledge sharing
	was more strongly associated with performance when work groups were
	more structurally diverse. Implications for theory and practice around
	the integration of work groups and social networks are addressed.

	of software technologies focusing on the management of the complete
	lifecycle of a business process. To date, most BPM deployments have
	been narrow in scope, adopting an organization-centric view and providing
	only improvements in specific business functions. As a result, current
	BPM suites only enable organizations to enhance their existing processes.
	The next-generation of service-enabled BPM will serve as a means
	of developing mission-critical applications based on strategic technology
	capable of creating and executing cross- enterprise collaborative
	business processes and business-aware transactions, so that organizations
	can deploy, monitor, and continuously update cross-enterprise functions
	within a mixed environment of people, content, and systems. Such
	collaborative, complex end-to-end service interactions give raise
	to the concept of Agile Service Networks. In this report, we assess
	the state-of-the-art in BPM, surveying the basic concepts, describe
	the features, techniques and enabling technologies necessary for
	making BPM a reality and explain the need for service-based BPM.
	The report also highlights the need for moving from a relatively
	static and organization-centric view of BPM to a much more dynamic,
	high- value one based on Agile Service Networks.},

	a structured technique for understanding the tradeoffs inherent in
	the architectures of software-intensive systems. This method was
	developed to provide a principled way to evaluate a software architecture's
	fitness with respect to multiple competing quality attributes: modifiability,
	security, performance, availability, and so forth. These attributes
	interact-improving one often comes at the price of worsening one
	or more of the others-as is shown in the paper, and the method helps
	us to reason about architectural decisions that affect quality attribute
	interactions. The {ATAM} is a spiral model of design: one of postulating
	candidate architectures followed by analysis and risk mitigation,
	leading to refined architectures},

  abstract = {Many architectural languages have been proposed in the last 15 years,
	each one with the chief aim of becoming the ideal language for specifying
	software architectures. What is evident nowadays, instead, is that
	architectural languages are defined by stakeholder concerns. Capturing
	all such concerns within a single, narrowly focused notation is impossible.
	At the same time, it is also impractical to define and use a {\^{a}}€{\oe}universal{\^{a}}€?
	notation, such as UML. As a result, many domain-specific notations
	for architectural modeling have been proposed, each one focusing
	on a specific application domain, analysis type, or modeling environment.
	As a drawback, a proliferation of languages exists, each one with
	its own specific notation, tools, and domain specificity. No effective
	interoperability is possible to date. Therefore, if a software architect
	has to model a concern not supported by his own language/tool, he
	has to manually transform (and, eventually, keep aligned) the available
	architectural specification into the required language/tool. This
	paper presents DUALLy, an automated framework that allows architectural
	languages and tools interoperability. Given a number of architectural
	languages and tools, they can all interoperate thanks to automated
	model transformation techniques. DUALLy is implemented as an Eclipse
	plugin. Putting it in practice, we apply the DUALLy approach to the
	Darwin/FSP ADL and to a UML2.0 profile for software architectures.
	By making use of an industrial complex system, we transform a UML
	software architecture specification in Darwin/FSP, make some verifications
	by using LTSA, and reflect changes required by the verifications
	back to the UML specification.},

	software process models to ensure their continued usefulness in global
	organisations. We have developed a software process, Global Teaming,
	which includes specific practices and sub-practices. Our purpose

  abstract = {Scenario-based design is a family of techniques in which the use of
	a future system is concretely described at an early point in the
	development process. Narrative descriptions of envisioned usage episodes
	are then employed in a variety of ways to guide the development of
	the system that will enable these use experiences. Like other user-centered
	approaches, scenario-based design changes the focus of design work
	from defining system operations (i.e., functional specification)
	to describing how people will use a system to accomplish work tasks
	and other activities. However, unlike approaches that consider human
	behavior and experience through formal analysis and modeling of well-specified
	tasks, scenario-based design is a relatively lightweight method for
	envisioning future use possibilities. A user interaction scenario
	is a sketch of use. It is intended to vividly capture the essence
	of an interaction design, much as a two-dimensional, paper-and-pencil
	sketch captures the essence of a physical design.},

	businesses seldom understand this axiom in terms of the communities
	through which individuals develop and share the capacity to create
	and use knowledge. It is the collective learning that takes place
	within the social systems, i.e. communities of practice (CoP) that
	are of particular significance to an organization from a KM perspective.
	This paper aims to review, critique, and raise some pertinent questions
	on the role of CoPs; and with the help of case studies shed light
	on the "goings-on" in construction practices. After critically reviewing
	the literature on CoPs and querying some underlying assertions, this
	research investigates how these issues are addressed in practice.
	A case study approach is adopted. From the findings, it is clear
	that the question is not whether communities exist within organizations,
	but how they deliver value to the organization.},

  publisher = {Princeton University Press},

  editor = {Latham, Robert and Sassen, Saskia},
  address = {Princeton, NJ},
  abstract = {Review Comprehensive and insightful, Digital Formations will be greeted
	warmly in the fields that overlap its concerns. It addresses a most
	important set of questions concerning the relationship of information
	technologies to globalization. And this is an urgent topic for social
	science.
	
	Book Description Computer-centered networks and technologies are reshaping
	social relations and constituting new social domains on a global
	scale, from virtually borderless electronic markets and Internet-based
	large-scale conversations to worldwide open source software development
	communities, transnational corporate production systems, and the
	global knowledge-arenas associated with NGO networks. This book explores
	how such 'digital formations' emerge from the ever-changing intersection
	of computer-centered technologies and the broad range of social contexts
	that underlie much of what happens in cyberspace.
	
	While viewing technologies fundamentally in social rather than technical
	terms, Digital Formations nonetheless emphasizes the importance of
	recognizing the specific technical capacities of digital technologies.
	Importantly, it identifies digital formations as a new area of study
	in the social sciences and in thinking about globalization. The ten
	chapters, by leading scholars, examine key social, political, and
	economic developments associated with these new configurations of
	organization, space, and interaction. They address the operation
	of digital formations and their implications for the development
	of longstanding institutions and for their wider contexts and fields,
	and they consider the political, economic, and other forces shaping
	those formations and how the formations, in turn, are shaping such
	forces.
	
	Following a conceptual introduction by the editors are chapters by
	Hayward Alker, Jonathan Bach and David Stark, Lars-Erik Cederman
	and Peter A. Kraus, Dieter Ernst, D. Linda Garcia, Doug Guthrie,
	Robert Latham, Warren Sack, Saskia Sassen, and Steven Weber.},

We describe the Cynefin framework, a sense-making device we have developed to help people make sense of the complexities made visible by the relaxation of these assumptions. The Cynefin framework is derived from several years of action research into the use of narrative and complexity theory in organizational knowledge exchange, decision-making, strategy, and policy-making. The framework is explained, its conceptual underpinnings are outlined, and its use in group sense-making and discourse is described. Finally, the consequences of relaxing the three basic assumptions, using the Cynefin framework as a mechanism, are considered.}

	Volume = {6},
	Year = {1995},
	Abstract = {In this research, a study of the effects of coordination mechanisms and risk drivers such as project uncertainty on the performance of software development projects was conducted. Two types of coordination mechanisms were considered: vertical and horizontal. The former refers to the extent to which coordination between users and IS staff is undertaken by authorized entities such as project managers or steering committees. The latter refers to the extent to which coordination is undertaken through mutual adjustments and communications between users and IS staff. A new research model was developed by synthesizing research using the structural contingency perspective from Organization Theory and the risk-based perspective in Software Engineering. The model suggests that residual performance risk, i.e., the difficulty in estimating performance-related outcomes during the later stages of the project, can clarify the relationship between project uncertainty, coordination mechanisms and performance. Eight hypotheses were derived from the model for empirical testing. Data were collected from 64 software development projects in the banking and other industries. The results provide considerable support for a revised research model. As expected, project uncertainty increases residual performance risk. Both in turn have a direct negative effect on performance. Vertical coordination significantly reduces both project uncertainty and residual performance risk. However, horizontal coordination does not have any significant effect on residual performance risk. Instead, it has a direct positive effect on project performance. Moreover, higher levels of both vertical and horizontal coordination lead to higher levels of overall performance. Their differential impacts on residual performance risk are interesting areas of future research.}}
